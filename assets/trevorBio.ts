My name is Trevor Munoz and I was born and raised in Corona, CA

I’m a Health coach and run an online business where I coach people 1 on 1 and teach frustrated individuals how to find clarity with nutrition and fitness and finally achieve sustainable results without giving up foods they love 🍔💪🏼

Growing up I was the “Skinny” kid and didn’t have a lot of athleticism/strength and lacked confidence.

I started to lift at 15 years old to build my body up.A couple years later the lack of Strength and Confidence were no longer an issue.

At the age of 16 I got jumped and then decided to sign up at @cquencebjj and learn jiu-jitsu to defend myself.I trained and competed from 2006-2012. 🥋

Before I became a health coach there was a time where I thought I wanted to be an actor and went to acting school for a year.🎭

I decided that wasn’t for me and shortly after that I started personal training people in 2011.In 2013 I felt that coaching people through health and fitness was my vocation so I dropped out of college that year to pursue it full time.

A perfect day for me is going to a movie and going out to dinner after(Im simple ha)

I was raised by a single mother in the 90’s and that meant listening to Sarah Mclachlan when we were driving and watching Buffy the Vampire slayer in the evenings😂🤣So my taste in music and film is obscure needless to say.

I used to play the saxophone 🎷

Some of my favorite foods are pizza, burgers, and sweet potato fries🍕🍔

My favorite sweets are @paderiabakehouse cookies and sees candies🍪🍫

I’m 31years old

I’m married to @coach_nataliam 💍

Im Catholic✝️

I wake up early (4am) and go to bed early.

Every year I go camping in Bridgeport,CA with the whole family where we fish, hike, swim, shoot bows, guns, ride horses etc.I’ll take the mountains over the beach any day.🏹🎣

I love coffee☕️

Biggest Inspiration= My mom👸🏻

The Last time I saw my father I was 7 years old.

Serving others brings me the most peace and satisfaction💯
